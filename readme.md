# PING Bootcamp Practice API Documentation

This API provides multiple endpoints for generating requested custom words or phrases using the `claude-3-sonnet` language model from Anthropic. The API is built using Python and the `requests` library for making HTTP requests.

## Endpoints

### 1. `/rhyme`

This endpoint accepts a string as input and returns a single line of poetry that rhymes with the provided string.

**Example Usage:**

```python
import requests

string = "The sun shines bright on the meadow's path"
url = "https://your-api-url.com/rhyme"
payload = {"string": string}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload)

if response.status_code == 200:
    rhyming_line = response.json()["rhyming_line"]
    print(rhyming_line)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
```

### 2. `/define`

This endpoint accepts a string as input and returns the definition of the provided word or phrase.

**Example Usage:**

```python
import requests

word = "luscious"
url = "https://your-api-url.com/define"
payload = {"string": word}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload)

if response.status_code == 200:
    definition = response.json()["definition"]
    print(definition)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
```

## Theoretical Concepts

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This API utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to generate rhyming lines and definitions based on the provided input. NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and human languages, enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human-like language.

### Language Models

The API leverages the `claude-3-sonnet-20240229` language model from Anthropic, which is specifically trained for poetic and vocabulary tasks. Language models are statistical models that learn patterns and relationships from vast amounts of text data, allowing them to generate human-like text based on the given context or prompt.

### Temperature

The `temperature` parameter in the API controls the randomness or creativity of the generated output. A higher temperature value (e.g., 0.8) will result in more diverse and creative responses, while a lower temperature (e.g., 0.2) will produce more predictable and conservative outputs.

### System Prompt

The API utilizes a "system prompt" to instruct the language model on the specific task it should perform. For the `/rhyme` endpoint, the system prompt instructs the model to act as a poetic assistant and generate a rhyming line based on the provided input. Similarly, for the `/define` endpoint, the system prompt instructs the model to act as a vocabulary assistant and provide a definition for the given word or phrase.

### Role-based Conversation

The API simulates a conversation between a user and an assistant by providing a series of messages with assigned roles (`"user"` and `"assistant"`). This conversational format allows the language model to better understand the context and generate more relevant and coherent responses.

## Limitations and Considerations

- The API's performance and output quality may vary depending on the input data and the specific language model used.
- The generated responses are based on the training data and biases present in the language model, which may lead to inconsistencies or inaccuracies.
- The API does not handle edge cases or malformed inputs gracefully, and appropriate input validation should be implemented on the client-side.
- The API does not currently support authentication or rate limiting, which may be necessary for production environments.
